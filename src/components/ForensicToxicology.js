                            Forensic Toxicology is a crucial discipline within forensic science that focuses on the detection, identification, and analysis of toxic substances, Including drugs, alcohol, poisons, and other chemicals, in biological specimens. This field plays a vital role in criminal investigations, helping to determine whether toxic substances contributed to an individual's death, impaired their judgment, or influenced their behavior. By combining principles from chemistry, biology, and pharmacology, forensic toxicologists provide critical insights into legal cases, assisting in the resolution of issues related to drug overdoses, poisonings, and substance abuse. At ARK Defin Technologies LLP, our expertise in forensic toxicology supports a wide range of investigative and legal processes, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the analysis of toxic substances.
